## Compiling Nibble from source

### Linux / Ubuntu

##### Prerequisites

- You will need the following dependencies to build the Nibble CLI: boost, cmake, git, gcc, g++, python, and make.
- On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python-dev gcc g++ git cmake libboost-all-dev`

#### Building

- `git clone https://github.com/Nibble-Network/Nibble`
- `cd Nibble`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`

If the build is successful the binaries will be in the src folder.

### Windows 10

##### Prerequisites

- Install [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16)
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- When installing Visual Studio, you need to install **Desktop development with C++** and the **MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools** components. The option to install the v142 build tools can be found by expanding the "Desktop development with C++" node on the right. You will need this for the project to build correctly.
- Use the premade binaries for [MSVC 14.2]
- Install [Boost 1.70.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.70.0/boost_1_70_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe/download), ensuring you download the installer for MSVC 14.2.

##### Building

- From the start menu, open 'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for vs2019' or run "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\Tools\VsMSBuildCmd.bat" from any command prompt.

- `git clone https://github.com/Nibble-Network/Nibble`
- `cd Nibble`
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2017" -A x64 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="c:\local\boost_1_70_0\lib64-msvc-14.2 ..` (Or your boost installed dir.)
- `msbuild nibbleX.sln /p:Configuration=Release /m`

If the build is successful the binaries will be in the src/Release folder.

### macOS

#### Prerequisites

In order to install prerequisites, [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) needs to be installed.
Once both are ready, open terminal app, run following command:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

and install all tools. On newer macOS versions (v10.14 and higher) this step is done through Software Update app.

After that, proceed with installing dependencies:

```bash
$ brew install git python cmake gcc boost
```

When all dependencies are installed, build nibble Core binaries:

```bash
$ `git clone https://github.com/Nibble-Network/Nibble`
$ `cd Nibble`
$ mkdir build && cd $_
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

If the build is successful the binaries will be located in `src` directory.
